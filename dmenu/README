dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X. This is my fork of dmenu. I haven't changed much, though
I plan to add more patches later on.

See the original git source at <https://git.suckless.org/dmenu>

patches
-------

- center (makes dmenu centered + vertical)
- border (adds a border support to dmenu)

Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details.
